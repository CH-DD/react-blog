# Look into...

- unique page titles. Consider React Helmet https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-customize-the-title-of-any-page-in-react-45ef14d2a695 or look at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46160461/how-do-you-set-the-document-title-in-react.  demo of custom util function: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-Cckbc0hKA
- components for loading and error code
- ways to store html formatting data in article 'body' - headings, paragraphs etc. For front end look at writing the article body using markdown. eg. https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-draft-wysiwyg & https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown
- new brand - maybe personal coding-related blog. could change to match cv styling (screenshot initial design for reference). 
- custom favicon to replace default react icon
- insert some more realistic dummy content
